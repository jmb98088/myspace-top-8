      <li>Location: Omaha</li>

    <img src= "#" alt="Photo of Jaimee Jude">
    <p class="friend-description">How do I do justice to my best friend and better half in a couple of sentences? 
      Jude is 4 years younger than me and went to school at Gonzaga in Spokane, Washington.
      Jai just moved back to Omaha (yay!) and is working for TD Ameritrade.
      She's into running, coding, cooking vegetarian foods, and just being weird with me.
      FYI, you won't find a more curious person.
      She knows a shitton about chitons and tidepools. Ask her for an animal fact.</p>
                   
  <h2>Sarah (Carnes) Packer</h2
    <ul>
    <li>Creighton/Ireland/Chicago est. 2011</li>
    <li>Location: Chicago</li>
    <li>Origin: Kansas City</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="#" alt="Photo of Sarah Packer">
    <p class="friend-description">Sarah and I met because our dads bonded over futon assembly on our first day of college. 
      She lived across the hall. We've done more life together than anyone on this list. Study abroad in Limerick, Ireland. Nursing school. 
      3x a week zumba class legends. 
      Several years of living together, most notably moving to Southport in Chicago. 
      She's married to Delta pilot Josh Packer and due with a baby in Feburary.
      Sarah pushes me to be a better communicator and thinker. </p>
    
  <h2>Alise Perault</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>High School est. 2010</li>
      <li>Location: Boston --> Red Cloud, NE?</li>
      <li>Origin: Columbus</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="#" alt="Photo of Alise Perault">
    <p class="friend-description">Alise is my coolest friend (sorry, other guys). We met in first grade but became besties in high school.
      Her taste and fashion are so distinctive. She makes anything look good. 
      Alise went to UNK, moved to Denver for a bit to work at a historic home, then moved to Boston to get a grad degree in 
      historic preservation. She's outspoken, empathetic, and SO MUCH FUN. She loves history, feminism, and mermaids. 
      She's also single and doesn't want kids either, so we are kind of soul mates.</p>
    
  <h2>Jenn (Gokie) Tran</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>>Grade School est. 1999</p></li>
      <li>Location: Lincoln</p></li>
      <li>Origin: Columbus</p></li>
    </ul>
    <img src="#" alt="Photo of Jenn Tran">
    <p class="friend-description"> Jenn was my first friend when we moved to Columbus when I was 3. Our families are so close. I was maid-of-honor in her wedding,
      and it was ahem, SUCH an honor. The thing about Jenn is that we are completely opposite of each other. She's a homebody and traditional, and you know me. 
      We appreciate that about each other. Living with her while I was in Lincoln for a travel nursing job was an exceptional season in my life.
      Jenn is an assistant principal at St. Peter's grade school in Lincoln. She's married to Khoi, and they have baby Ollie.</p>

  <h2>Julie Green</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Chicago est. 2017</p></li>
      <li>Location: Chicago</p></li>
      <li>Origin: Ohio</p></u></li>
    </ul>
    <img src="#" alt="Photo of Julie Green">
    <p class="friend-description">I met Julie on a Catholic young adult retreat through St. Alphonsus in Chicago. 
      Knowing she would challenge me to grow in my faith, I invited her to join my women's faith development group 
      which we were part of for about 2 years before I moved.
      We went to Germany together during Oktoberfest 2018 (#lederhoseneffect) and were supposed to go to Japan during April 2020. It'll happen someday.
      Julie works as a software engineer at Capitol One. She loves city life, dive bars, cats, and tech. 
      She's reflective, knows what she believes, and is straight to the point.</p>
